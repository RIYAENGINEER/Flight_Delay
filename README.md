# Flight_Delay
This project focuses on predicting flight delays using a real-world dataset containing over 1.7 million records. The goal is to develop a regression model that can estimate the number of minutes a flight will be delayed based on various features such as airline, route, scheduled/actual departure times, and aircraft details.
